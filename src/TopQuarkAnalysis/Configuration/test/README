Steering:
=========

Some very basic steering switches are found at the top of the configurations:
- runOnMC         : self-explaining
- runMatch        : to switch on/off MC matching
- runCiC          : to switch on/off the addition of the CiC electron ID variables
                    to the electrons
- runEwk          : to switch on/off the addition of the electron ID variables
                    defined by the EWK PAG working points to the electrons
- addGenEvt       : produces and adds the TQAF MC event;
                    needs also the GenParticles, so some space...
- hltProcess      : process name of the HLT, needed to be adapted for re-DIGI MC
- triggerSelection: defines logical expression for HLT selection;
                    no slection, if empty
- jetAlgo         : (pseudo-)identifier of used jet algorithm (others than "AK5"
                    have not been tested -- and will not work)
- jecLevels       : list of stored JECs

- {muon, electron}IsoR       : radius to compute the isolation
- {muon, electron}sIsoTP     : cut value for combined isolation of objects to be
                               kept in PF top projection procedure
- {muon, electron, jet}Select: selection string cut for objects to be stored in the
                               output
- {muon, electron, jet}sCut  : selection string cut for objects used in the event
                               selection
- {muon, electron, jet}sMin  : minimum number of objects fulfilling the event
                               selection cut
- leptonsMin                 : minimum number of sum of leptons fulfilling the event
                               selection cut

Remarks:
========

Selection:
----------

The selection criteria for objects used in the event selection are chosen as the
minimum found in the Top PAG l+jets reference selection, incl. veto leptons plus
an additional margin for meaningful N-1-plots.

For the event selection, the parameters '{muon, electron}sMin' on the one hand and
'leptonsMin' on the other hand count the same objects, where the first counts muons
and electrons separately and the latter the sum of both. A logical "OR" (select
events with either an electron or a muon) can be acchieved by setting the first to
'0' and the latter to '1'.

Jets:
-----

The following settings might be objects to optimisation:
- b-Tagging   : re-run and added
- JTA         : not added
- jet charge  : not added
- constituents: not added

For MC, the GenJet match is removed in any case.

JEC:
----

The following settings might be objects to optimisation:
- JEC levels  : which to apply, which to store

Note, that the actually applied JEC depends on the JECs stored (details in PAT
documentation).

MET:
----

Note that all METs in these configurations are uncorrected, since PF.
CaloMET (corrections available) is removed.

MC:
---

If no MC match is performed, the GenParticles are kept in the event content.
This should also be sufficient to reconstruct the TtGenEvent in the TQAF.

Tests:
======

The tests are performed on CMSSW_4_2_5 RelVal samples:
- MC  : /RelValTTbar/CMSSW_4_2_5-START42_V12-v2/GEN-SIM-RECO (8900 evts.)
- data: /Mu/CMSSW_4_2_5-GR_R_42_V14_mu2010B-v2/RECO (run over 8900 evts.)
        /Elecktron/CMSSW_4_2_5-GR_R_42_V14_electron2010B-v2/RECO (run over 8900 evts.)
There are no Run2011A data samples available as RelVal in CMSSW_4_2_X (but in CMSSW_4_3_X).

The CMSSW timing service has been added and its summary is found at the end of the
Fwk output.

Additional information on the event size from 'edmEventSize' is also added.
