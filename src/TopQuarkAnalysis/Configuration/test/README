Steering:
=========

Some very basic steering switches are found at the top of the configurations:
- runOnMC         : self-explaining
- runMatch        : to switch on/off MC matching
- runCiC          : to switch on/off the addition of the CiC electron ID variables
                    to the electrons
- runEwk          : to switch on/off the addition of the electron ID variables
                    defined by the EWK PAG working points to the electrons
- addGenEvt       : produces and adds the TQAF MC event;
                    needs also the GenParticles, so some space...
- filterDecayChannels              : select events based on their semi-leptonic decay channel
- add{Muon,Electron,Tau}Channel    : switch on leptons to keep; putting all to 'False' will select the hadronic channel
- restrictTauChannel{Muon,Electron}: switches for leptonic decay channels of the tau to keep; putting all to 'False' will keep all tau channels
- hltProcess      : process name of the HLT, needed to be adapted for re-DIGI MC
- triggerSelection: defines logical expression for HLT selection;
                    no slection, if empty
- jetAlgo         : (pseudo-)identifier of used jet algorithm (others than "AK5"
                    have not been tested -- and will not work)
- jecLevels       : list of stored JECs
- pvCollections   : name of primary vertex collection to be used in PF2PAT

- pf{Muon, Electron}Select           : selection string cut for objects to be kept in PF2PAT
                                       top projections
- usePf{Muon, Electron}IsoConeR03IsoR: to switch on/off the use of radius 0.3 to compute the
                                       isolation; "off" uses the radius 0.4 instead
- pf{Muon, Electron}Iso              : cut value for combined isolation of objects to be
                                       kept in PF top projection procedure
- {muon, electron, jet}Select        : selection string cut for objects to be stored in the
                                       output
- {muon, electron, jet}Cut           : selection string cut for objects used in the event
                                       selection
- {muon, electron, jet}sMin          : minimum number of objects fulfilling the event
                                       selection cut
- leptonsMin                         : minimum number of sum of leptons fulfilling the event
                                       selection cut


Remarks:
========

Selection:
----------

The selection criteria for objects used in the event selection are chosen as the
minimum found in the Top PAG l+jets reference selection, incl. veto leptons plus
an additional margin for meaningful N-1-plots.

For the event selection, the parameters '{muon, electron}sMin' on the one hand and
'leptonsMin' on the other hand count the same objects, where the first counts muons
and electrons separately and the latter the sum of both. A logical "OR" (select
events with either an electron or a muon) can be acchieved by setting the first to
'0' and the latter to '1'.

Jets:
-----

The following settings might be objects to optimisation:
- b-Tagging   : re-run and added
- JTA         : not added
- jet charge  : not added
- constituents: not added

For MC, the matching to generator particles match is switched on on demand. Matching
to jets from generator particles is kept separately, since it increases the data
volume remarkably.

JEC:
----

The following settings might be objects to optimisation:
- JEC levels  : which to apply, which to store

Note, that the actually applied JEC depends on the JECs stored (details in PAT
documentation).

MET:
----

Note that all METs in these configurations are uncorrected, since PF.
CaloMET (corrections available) is removed.

MC:
---

If no MC match is performed, the GenParticles are kept in the event content.
